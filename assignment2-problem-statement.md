# Problem Statement

## Brief Introduction
The world needs more weather visualizations. We'll provide historical and real-time visualizations of weather. We'll use Canadian data to start but the solution will be location agnostic.

## Define problem
(What needs to be improved in the world?)
We are looking to provide a detailed, visualization-focused analysis of historical and real-time weather. The world, specifically people who enjoy looking at graphs and data visualizations, could benefit from our amazing and varied weather visualizing techniques. From casual visualization-viewers, to full-time graph-enthusiasts -- anyone may benefit from our weather visualizations.

## Functional and non-functional requirements
### Functional Requirements:
The program must provide varied weather graphs.  
The program must be hosted and accessable on a server via the web.  


### Non-functional requirements:
The program may...  
## System limitations

## Development Environment
The backend is written in Python using the Django framework and a PostgreSQL database.

The frontend is written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. The CSS framework, Bulma, is being leveraged along with the Nuxt.js, a JavaScript framework built on top of Vue.js.

Revision control for both code bases is handled with git and backed up to GitHub.com. Development of features and bug-fixes is completed in separate repository branches, then merged to master after a code review. The code in master is automatically deployed to a staging site for review and user testing. When development is complete and the staging site has passed user testing, it will be pushed to the production site.

The staging site for the backend is Heroku.com and for the frontend it is Netlify.com.

The production server will be a custom build on a DigitalOcean.com VPS.
